# Security Policy

## Reporting

Please report security vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories / Private Vulnerability Reporting when available. Do not publish exploitable details, real credentials, customer data, or destructive proof-of-concept material in a public issue.

Include the affected component, impact, reproduction conditions, and a minimal non-destructive proof.

## Security expectations

Changes involving authentication, authorization, tenant/company isolation, secrets, external providers, webhooks, payments, files, or state-changing AI/tool actions should include targeted negative and boundary tests.

Never commit production credentials, API keys, OAuth secrets, database passwords, private certificates, real session tokens, or customer exports.

## Verification boundary

Security claims must follow repository evidence. A source-level control is not the same as a passing regression test, and a passing focused test is not production certification.

## Responsible disclosure

Good-faith testing should use synthetic/test data, avoid service disruption, minimize access to data not owned by the researcher, and allow reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure.
